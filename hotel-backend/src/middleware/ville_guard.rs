//! HF Ville write admission gate (ADR 0002 / Ship-A).
//!
//! When `HFVILLE_WRITES_ENABLED` is off, every mutating request carrying
//! `?branch=hfville` is rejected with 403 BEFORE it can reach a handler that
//! would write the HF Hotel pool. The `branch` query param is parsed properly
//! (URL-decoded), never substring-matched.
//!
//! Lives in the lib (not `main.rs`) so the decision is unit-testable and so
//! integration tests can drive the REAL layered router — see
//! `tests/test_hk_ville_guard.rs`.
//!
//! ## The exemptions (housekeeping-ops, 2026-08-11; linen 2026-08-31;
//! room signals 2026-09-01)
//!
//! [`is_ville_exempt_path`] admits, regardless of the flag, exactly the maid
//! surface's own write routes — and nothing else:
//!
//! * `POST /api/hk/rooms/{id}/cleaning` — the cleaning report.
//! * `POST /api/hk/rooms/{id}/linen-shortage` — the linen-shortage (ขาดผ้า)
//!   report (migration 088). **PG-ONLY**: it inserts `ht_hk_linen_reports` rows
//!   and nothing else — no writeback intent, no outbox row, no domain event,
//!   because iHOTEL has no linen counterpart to mirror to. So the
//!   admission-vs-delivery argument below does not merely hold for it, it is
//!   vacuous: there is no intent that `HFVILLE_WRITEBACK_INTENTS` could park as
//!   `'skipped'`, hence no way for canonical PG to run ahead of Ville's iHOTEL.
//!   This is the safest possible thing to exempt.
//! * `POST /api/hk/rooms/{id}/signals` and
//!   `POST /api/hk/signals/{id}/{ack|done|cancel|answer}` — the room signals of
//!   ADR 0008 (migration 089). **PG-ONLY on the same terms as linen, and
//!   irreversibly so**: `ht_hk_room_signals` has no legacy counterpart to
//!   mirror to, so there is no writeback recipe to write, no intent to
//!   allowlist, and no dark flag waiting to enable one. They DO publish domain
//!   events — but those are `event_log` + `pg_notify` rows feeding this app's
//!   own SSE fan-out, not a legacy write, and the writeback worker dispatches
//!   `WritebackIntent`s, not events.
//!
//!   The DESK half of the same feature (`/api/housekeeping/signals/*`) is
//!   deliberately NOT exempt. The exemption exists so a MAID's work is not
//!   collateral damage of a front-desk write-policy toggle; a front-desk
//!   mutation is exactly what that toggle governs.
//!
//! ### Current production state
//!
//! `HFVILLE_WRITES_ENABLED=true` has been set since 2026-06-29 — Ville coequal
//! writes are LIVE — so this gate admits everything and the exemption is
//! **inert in production today**. It exists for the case where an operator
//! turns Ville writes back off: the maid surface is a different concern from
//! front-desk write policy, and a housekeeping report should not be collateral
//! damage of that toggle.
//!
//! The exemption does NOT punch a hole in the real kill switch for Ville legacy
//! writes. This gate is HTTP ADMISSION only; legacy delivery is stopped by
//! `HFVILLE_WRITEBACK_ENABLED=false` on the Ville worker (or narrowed by
//! `HFVILLE_WRITEBACK_INTENTS`). With writes disabled, an admitted cleaning
//! report flips canonical PG and its writeback waits in the durable outbox.
//!
//! ### Why an exemption rather than flipping the flag
//!
//! If Ville writes were ever disabled and we re-enabled them wholesale just to
//! let maids through, every other Ville mutation would be admitted too. Should
//! `HFVILLE_WRITEBACK_INTENTS` be narrow at that moment, those mutations would
//! write canonical PG while their intents parked as `'skipped'` — canonical PG
//! and Ville's iHOTEL silently diverging. Keeping the admitted set narrow keeps
//! admission and delivery consistent under every combination of the two knobs.
//!
//! The exemptions are deliberately NARROW: exact segment match against a
//! closed list of leaf names, POST only, numeric room id. They do NOT cover
//! `/broken-items` (retired, 410) or any other hk or non-hk mutation.
